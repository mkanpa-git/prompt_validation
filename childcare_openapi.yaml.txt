    Application Details JSON Response. The generic structure is represented by the schema  `ApplicationSubmission` and the data element *Forms.FormInputDocument* references the Childcare service specific schema `CFWB012`. <br/><br/>
    
    Notes:<br/>
      1. Unlike the CFWB-012 PDF, in the JSON response, the FamilyMembers collection do not include record for Applicant/ Self.  Family Size should be calculated by summing up Applicant + ChildrenNeedingCare + FamilyMembers.
